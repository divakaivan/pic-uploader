## Website to upload images

Small project, connected to firebase store and db.

Upload images which are saved into firebase.

The project consisted of `react hooks` and also creating custom hooks which is one of the main reason I decided to do it.
And also it introduced `framer-motion` animations. Something I have seen around but have not gotten my hands on, up until this.

To start a dev version - `npm run start` and visit http://localhost:3000/
